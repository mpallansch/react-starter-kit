### Installation and Usage

1. Install the package in your React project `npm install @cdc/chart`
2. Import the component and begin using in your code.
```JSX
import CdcMap from '@cdc/chart'

function App() {

  return (
    <div className="App">

## Contributing

To get started working on this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the monorepo and do an `lerna bootstrap`. This installs all dependencies. Then you can navigate to `/packages/cdc-charts/` and do `npm link` to link the namespace `@cdc/chart` to your local project (see step 4 for more.)
2. Simply run `lerna run --scope @cdc/chart start` and it will open the project in development mode.
3. To create an actual built version of the library for testing, run `lerna run --scope @cdc/chart build`
4. To test the package out locally inside a different project, after building you need to go into that folder and run `npm link @cdc/chart`. It should begin using your local version so you can make changes and view them.
